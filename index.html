            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer currently living in Maryland, about 30 mins from our nation's capital Washington, DC</p>
            <p>I most recently left my position as a Mail Carrier at the United States Postal Service,

            <p>
                My biggest interest are:

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I graduated high school in 2008 and took some Web Design and Photoshop classes in college.  I left college after about two years
                because I had accepted a position with the post office and it would require a lot of my time.  After 7 years at the post office, I have
                decided that it is time to focus on a career that I am truly interested in. And is not just good for paying the bills.
            </p>
            <p> I turned in my resignation letter and doubled down on my education.  I am committing myself full time to this Thinkful program.
                And I extremely hopeful for the future.
            </p>
            <p>I am very big into cars and art.  I also like to read, watch action movies, and finding new music to listen to. 
                I am looking forward to learning and growing within these next few months and truly building a community.  Please don't
                hesitate to reach out to me, we can work together and build great things.
